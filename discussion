From the recursive spectral modularity partitioning, the Karate Club network was split into multiple communities, and centrality metrics were tracked across iterations. Several observations emerge:

Persistent Central Nodes

Nodes 0 (the instructor) and 33 (the administrator) consistently remain the most central throughout the splits.

They have the highest degree centrality (many direct connections) and also maintain high closeness (short distance to others).

Their betweenness centrality also stays high because they act as bridges between different communities.

Effect of Community Splitting

After partitioning, nodes located at boundaries between communities (e.g., nodes 0, 33, 2, 32) experience an increase in betweenness since they lie on shortest paths between groups.

Nodes inside small, dense communities show higher clustering coefficients but lower centrality, since their influence does not extend across communities.

Evolution of Metrics

Degree centrality does not change with partitioning (since edges remain the same), but its relative importance is clearer in identifying hubs.

Betweenness centrality highlights which nodes act as intermediaries once the network splits—especially nodes 0 and 33.

Closeness centrality decreases for peripheral nodes after splitting, as they become more distant from other communities.

Clustering coefficient is highest for nodes in tightly knit subgroups, showing how community structure reinforces local clustering.

Community Influence on Centrality

Community structure strongly determines which nodes are global versus local leaders.

Nodes 0 and 33 remain globally central, while others (like nodes 1, 2, 3, 32) are important within their respective communities but less central overall.
